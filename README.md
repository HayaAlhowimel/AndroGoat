#  AndroGoat - Application Penetration Testing

## 📝 Overview

The technical report details the methodology and results of an external breach conducted to test 
the security of the customer's application. The primary goal was to uncover vulnerabilities that 
could be exploited by an attacker without prior knowledge of the APK. The report utilizes various 
tools — jadx, mobsf, and adb — and we also use the BlueStacks emulator.
